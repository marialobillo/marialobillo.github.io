Yesterday I forked my first repo with the intention to contribute to Open Source. Yes, Open Source was always on my list but I'd never took the decision to jump on it. So, someone mentioned and why not? I thought. Since I started to learning code I've been using a lot of open source projects, are really awesome and I'm very grateful for that. And I think is a great way to work on something and everyone could use it.

So, I found this tutorial on "How to contribut to Nodejs":

[Contributing to the nodejs Core](https://blog.risingstack.com/contributing-to-the-node-js-core/)

On there basicaly you are going to fork the project, do the setup and building the binsaries. For sure, we don't forget the tests.

Not going to lie I felt a bit intimidated, but I decided to give it a try. I followed the steps and I was able to build the binaries. I was so happy (it takes a bit), I know is not a big deal but for me was a big step for me. I'm going to keep working on it, and I hope I can contribute to the project, crossing fingers :).

Of course, I started reading the guide lines to contribute to the project:

[Nodejs Contributing Guide](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/314c8f95c5b2f1d54cf465ae442f884fc4e342e6/CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you go to the [Issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues) section and you dn't know where to start, you can filter by "good first issue" and you will find a lot of issues to work on. I'm going to start with one of those.

I found some resources helping how to contribute to Open Source, there is an article by Jennifer Bland telling her story contributing to Nodejs Repo which is very inspiring, and she also has some youtube videos. The whole article is [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/contributing-to-open-source-is-not-hard-here-is-my-journey-to-contributing-to-nodejs-d10760e31194/)

And another resource that I found and I think is very useful is this one, is a youtube video which is an interview to Michael Dawson, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WtkRoGtbx4). There is a lot resource out there, but I think this is a good start.

Acording to Michael Dawson, a good place to start is checking out the [calendar](https://nodejs.org/calendar). This way we can know what is going on. And also, we can check the [Youtube Nodejs Lives](https://www.youtube.com/@nodejs-foundation/streams) in order to find old meetings what we could interested in.
