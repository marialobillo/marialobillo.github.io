I think my neighbor has the music at the highest volume. It's summer, the window is open and I can hear my neighbor's party from here. I suppose that many people want to relax and have a little fun, if it is possible to forget the last year or summarize all the things learned.

Yesterday I was working on a project using Laravel, and when he tried to upload the code to Github he gave me an error, that he had to use personal tokens. Instead, I have preferred to configure an ssh key. I know there is a wonderful tutorial on Github docs, but I found [this](https://jdblischak.github.io/2014-09-18-chicago/novice/git/05-sshkeys.html) one simpler to follow.
