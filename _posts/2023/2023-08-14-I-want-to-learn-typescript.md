TypeScript was released to the public in October 2012, since there the interest is been growing. You can check here on [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=typescript&hl=en) how the interest is growing.

Ok, now we know we want to learn typescript, but what is typescript? According to the official [website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): "typescript is a strongly typed programming language".


Here is a great article on Free Code Camp about getting started with typescript: [The Ultimate Beginners Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-typescript-beginners-guide/)




I like to learn by doing, so what kind of resources are out there to learn typescript by doing? There are a ton but one of them is [Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/) which is a platform to learn by doing. I've been using it for a while and I really like it.

In Execute Program they us 'spaced repetition' to help you remember what you've learned. Here there is an article about spaced repetition: [Spaced repetition](https://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/Learning%20Centres/Think_SpacedRepetition_LA.pdf)

If you like spaced repetition you can also try [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), which is a free and open-source flashcard program using spaced repetition, it's available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS, FreeBSD, Android and iOS. You can use it to learn anything, not only programming languages. :)
