It was probably the first of January of 2020 when I updated this blog the last time. I wannted to 
build my portfolio and Github pages sounds really good. Using Jekyll with Ruby is really interesting to me
because I don't remember the last time I've done a website using Ruby, and only with Rails. 

So here it is my 'new' portfolio-website, I haven't done so much settings on Jekyll. I've just added some layout and a menu, and Bootstrap for styling.
