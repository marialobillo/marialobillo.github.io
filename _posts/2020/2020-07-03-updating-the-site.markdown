Well, I don't remember how many times I've updated this site, and 
probably this is no the last one. So, I'm pretty happy with the 
first changes, so the index page is not bad. It's clear, white 
background. It's nice, everything has its own space and is 
telling things. So, always it could be better, but it's alright for now.

The Posts section is not clear where it should be, so there is a link at 
the bottom index. It's not a good idea, I know. And I have to change the 
style and make it as the index page.
