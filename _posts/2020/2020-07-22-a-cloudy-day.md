When we start building a new project, everything is new, everything looks exciting, marvelous. There are no words in the world that can be said about it. It is possible that we took a lot of time start the project, to be able to make this project a reality. About programming, and learning new things, this is what it is. Everyday there is something new to learn or a new tech that is calling our attetion.


In general, new frameworks and tools are solving some problems and making our life easier. Sometimes we try technologies that will not help our project, but we will try, keep trying because our neighboors are doing the same. Maybe the problem is getting obssed with a technology specifically that will solve all our problems, it is quite true.

There are times when I like to spend time with myself and thinking on being with the technologies that I have, or being obsessed with using only the cutting edge tool. Maybe are a moment to take a breath away, or maybe the reflection is necessary.
