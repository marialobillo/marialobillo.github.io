Probably today is one of the most hot days of summer, or maybe one of the rest of summer days. It's been hot since morning. 
But the code is there waiting for been written, so I got some more updates for this website and a new posts of course :).

I've been updating the post section and adding a new button on the main page for reading posts, not only at the end of the page. 
That was so complicated to find it. I wanted to show it more clear. Maybe the content of my posts are not quite interesting but it's what I'm writting those days.

Yesterday I made a small app with Laravel but I think this would deserver another posts itself, and putting more details about how is been Laravel changing on last years.
