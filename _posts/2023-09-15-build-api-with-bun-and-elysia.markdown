I love go for a walk in the morning and listening some podcasts. And I remember how excited I was listening Ryan Dahl talking about Deno on this podcast by ChangeLog:

[Exploring Deno Land](https://changelog.com/podcast/443)

I thought it's great to have more options a part from Nodejs, and improved version. But when I learned about Bun.sh in this video by Jarred Summer:

Here you can see how fast and incredible is bun.sh. Few days ago a lot of people were talking about on social media, so I decided to give it a try, and implementing a simple API with bun.sh and Elysia ( a similar framework to expressjs ). I would say everything is very intuitive, and easy to use because is very similar like we work on nodejs.

So, here is the link of the project, for now there is only a couple end points, but I'm going to add more in the future:
